# 3.0 Upgrade Notes

## `Shared.elm`

- Change `Cmd Msg` to `Effect Msg`
- `init` no longer passes in `Maybe Browser.Navigation.Key` - instead, `Effect.toCmd` receives the `Browser.Navigation.Key`

## Page -> RouteBuilder

- `buildWithLocalState` no longer receives `Maybe Browser.Navigation.Key` - use `Effect` instead

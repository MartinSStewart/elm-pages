module Path exposing
    ( Path, join, fromString
    , toAbsolute, toRelative, toSegments
    )

{-| Represents the path portion of a URL (not query parameters, fragment, protocol, port, etc.).

This helper lets you combine together path parts without worrying about having too many or too few slashes.
These two examples will result in the same URL, even though the first example has trailing and leading slashes, and the
second does not.

    Path.join [ "/blog/", "/post-1/" ]
        |> Path.toAbsolute
    --> "/blog/post-1"

    Path.join [ "blog", "post-1" ]
        |> Path.toAbsolute
    --> "/blog/post-1"

We can also safely join Strings that include multiple path parts, a single path part per string, or a mix of the two:

    Path.join [ "/articles/archive/", "1977", "06", "10", "post-1" ]
        |> Path.toAbsolute
    --> "/articles/archive/1977/06/10/post-1"
